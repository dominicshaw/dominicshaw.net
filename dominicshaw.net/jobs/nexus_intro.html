<h3>Nexus Open Software <span>Senior Software Developer, Dec 2005 â€“ Aug 2009</span></h3>
<p>
	At this software house of around 20 developers, I worked as part of a team for around two years before I was promoted to Senior Developer (<span>team leader</span>) and assigned my own project,
	a <span>CRM system</span>, to run with my own team. I continued with this project until I left Nexus two years later. This exposed me on a grander scale to the <span>full system life cycle</span> from technical
	specifications and modelling, through to release and maintenance process, including <span>meeting with clients</span> to discuss future development, then <span>planning and delegating</span> portions to the team.
	This product was targeted mainly at the financial and legal sectors.
