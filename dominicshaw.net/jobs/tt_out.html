	My time at TT can be best summarised by the projects listed below. Each of these projects has been built from scratch and the last two were written entirely by
	myself (with peer review and shared best practice). Each features a <span>WPF MVVM</span> front-end, a <span>WCF</span> middle-tier (although many new projects are now <span>Web API</span>), and a <span>SQL Server</span>
	backend. Each also has a lightweight <span>ASP.NET</span> front-end designed for remote access. They all make heavy use of <span>SSRS</span> and <span>DevExpress reporting</span>.

<ul>
	<li>
		A "to-the-second" <span>risk & exposure system</span>, specifically targeting hedge and macro teams but later rolled out to the long side as well. This was one of my first large projects
		at TT. Now mature, it has been, by any standard, very successful. It integrates directly with our PMS/OMS and with <span>Bloomberg</span> to deliver accurate profit and loss numbers in
		real-time. The work on this system was split largely into middle and front-end, between two developers. I took the WCF middle tier and the small amount of SQL (mostly loading
		from existing databases), while my colleague worked on the WPF front-end. I also authored the <span>ASP.NET front-end for remote access</span> to this system.
	</li>
	<li>
		A research system, which allows quick and easy storing and retrieval of research (models, broker reports, etc). The project, important to a research led investment firm, could
		have been simple however there was a lot of room for innovation. Some areas that I found to increase the effectiveness of the product were:
		<ul>
			<li>An <span>investment case</span> system, including automatic generation of a basic model with Bloomberg data;</li>
			<li>"Ideas" management for tracking stocks;</li>
			<li><span>Integration with the OMS</span> to tie everything together – i.e. what research is for what position / idea, association of research with stocks from the OMS, etc.;</li>
			<li>Plugins for Microsoft Office (with <span>VSTO toolbars</span>) and Adobe Reader (with their plugin SDK);</li>
			<li><span>Microsoft Exchange (EWS)</span> integration which read from a "deposit" mailbox to get notes sent via email, scrape out the associated companies and attachments and upload it all to the system. There is also functionality to scrape a general "research" mailbox for broker reports;</li>
			<li>Company Meeting management – input and scraping via Exchange (EWS) of categorised meetings in users calendars to coalesce into a single Company Meeting calendar.</li>
		</ul>
		This system replaced Advent's Tamale and was preferred by all users – not just in user experience but in functionality as well. The resounding success of this project led to my
		being given the reigns to developing another, highly integral system for the company:
	</li>
	<li>
		A "ticketing" application which allows the managers to <span>model a trade</span> for most asset classes and submit the ticket directly to traders and/or the OMS. The modelling functionality
		built into this allowed <span>automation</span> of things like <span>dispersion</span>, <span>CFD management</span>, <span>order sizing</span>, as well as any validation and <span>compliance</span> that the OMS is not suited to. My close work
		with fund managers on this project has enabled me to create a user friendly application that they were keen and confident to use. The successful uptake of this application by the
		fund managers reflected the real success of the project, especially as many were initially reticent to change an ingrained practice of paper ticketing.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	As with any small to medium sized company, there is often call for small applications; be that integrations between systems, web front-ends for simple tasks, scheduled jobs,
	or reports. This is something I am happy to absorb into my tasks, and this is a regular reality. Some examples include <span>IPO ticketing</span> and workflow, the <span>
	Compliance team's workflow application</span> (attestations, PA trading, regulatory reporting, etc.), <span>chart packs</span>, and many more.
