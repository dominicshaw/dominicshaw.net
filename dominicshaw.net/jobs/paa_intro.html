<h3>Pattern Analysis &amp; Applications (PAA) Journal <span>Jun 2004 - Nov 2004</span></h3>
<p>
	I was brought in by my 3<sup>rd</sup> year tutor after the successful completion of my dissertation.
	He ran PAA, a journal operating out of Exeter University, and hired me to write a paper submission
	system in PHP / MySql. The dissertation had been similar but in ASP.NET and SQL and he wanted to run
	it off a Linux box before Mono was established. This was a fast introduction to commercial software
	development and a steep but enjoyable learning curve.
