<p>
	I also created a role for myself as the main contact for all reporting work, having spent significant time working with <span>SSRS</span>. This is an area I find very rewarding because of the requirement
	of making the code as efficient as possible. I was regularly hired out as a consultant to companies on this subject, and also delivered Microsoft training courses on SSRS and SQL Server (T-SQL).
