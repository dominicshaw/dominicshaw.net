<h3>CMT Group <span>Junior Software Developer, Dec 2004 - Nov 2005</span></h3>
<p>
	The CMT Group was a great introduction to commercial software development. They operated for a wide range of companies. We had a team of four; two
	core developers, of which I was one, a manager who did some development, and a QA person. The largest single project was a VB6 application for a car
	salesman to track sales and create invoices. It used Crystal reports to raise invoices and was a multi-user system. I went on from there to develop
	a number of applications using a wide variety of technologies.
